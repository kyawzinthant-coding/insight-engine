Project Cygnus is a next-generation data streaming platform designed for real-time analytics. The primary goal is to reduce data latency to under 50 milliseconds for financial transactions. The core processing engine is built in Rust for performance, and it uses Apache Kafka for message queuing and Redis for caching intermediate results. The lead systems architect is Dr. Evelyn Reed. The next major milestone, codenamed 'Aquila', is to implement end-to-end encryption by the end of Q4. The project is currently in beta testing with three partner firms.
